# BashBingo
A bingo game written with bash that can be played on the terminal.

To play, provide an input file containing a seed integer and 25 other numbers to create the bingo card (5x5 matrix).

To create a bingo card:
column 1: 5 unique integers from [01-15]
column 2: 5 unique integers from [16-30]
column 3: 4 unique integers from [31-45] where the middle integer is 00
column 4: 5 unique integers from [46-60]
column 5: 5 unique integers from [61-75]
Ensure that each number includes 2 digits with one space in between, and the rest of the file has no extraneous whitespace, not even at the start or end of a line.
